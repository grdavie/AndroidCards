# Overview

Bati Cards is a simple greeting card maker app that allows users to create personalized greeting cards. Users can add a message, sign it, and select a background photo to create a unique card. 
The app is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy for anyone to create a personalized card for any occasion.

The purpose of creating the Bati Cards app is to demonstrate the basics of Android app development using Android Studio and Kotlin. 
By creating Bati Cards, I aim to further my learning as a software engineer and enhance my skills in Android app development.
